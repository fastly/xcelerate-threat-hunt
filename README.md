# Xcelerate Threat Hunt

This project provides a Jupyter notebook that assists Fastly Next-Gen WAF (NGWAF) customers in searching for threats associated with Out-of-Band Domains (OOB-DOMAIN). It demonstrates how to integrate with Fastly's API to retrieve requests from a site's request feed and provides boilerplate analysis for threat hunting.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Rename `sample.env` to `.env` and update the corresponding values
3. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed
